## üìä **EDA & Feature Engineering Summary**

### 1. **Data Overview**

* The dataset includes a wide range of smartphone specifications such as price, processor, camera details, battery, and support for features like 5G, NFC, and expandable memory.
* Several features contain missing values which were effectively handled using a machine learning-based imputation method (`IterativeImputer` with `RandomForestRegressor`), ensuring data quality for further analysis.

---

### 2. **Univariate Analysis Insights**

* **Extended Memory**: Most smartphones offer expandable memory, though newer models are trending away from it.
* **Number of Rear Cameras**: Devices generally have 2‚Äì3 rear cameras, which align with current market trends.
* **Processor Speed**: Varies widely, indicating a mix of entry-level and high-performance devices.
* **Has 5G**: A significant proportion of smartphones in the dataset support 5G.

### 3. **Bivariate Analysis Insights**

* **NFC vs 5G**:

  * More phones have 5G but lack NFC.
  * This suggests 5G is becoming common even in lower-budget phones that exclude premium features like NFC.
* **Number of Rear Cameras vs 5G**:

  * Phones with more rear cameras (especially 3) are more likely to support 5G.
  * Indicates that mid-range and premium phones combine both camera features and next-gen connectivity.
* **Expandable Memory vs 5G**:

  * Phones without expandable memory are more likely to have 5G.
  * Matches industry trends: brands phase out SD card slots in favor of faster internal storage, especially in 5G-ready devices.

---

### 4. **5G-Focused Feature Relationships**

* **Price**:

  * Higher-priced smartphones are more likely to have 5G.
  * Budget phones without 5G cluster under ‚Çπ15,000.
* **Rating**:

  * Phones with 5G tend to have higher average ratings.
* **Processor Brand**:

  * Devices with flagship chipsets from Qualcomm or MediaTek Dimensity series are more likely to support 5G.

### 5. **Feature Engineering Highlights**

New meaningful features were created:

* `price_range`: Bucketed price into categories (Budget, Midrange, Premium, Ultra).
* `performance_score`: Calculated as `num_cores √ó processor_speed`.
* `total_camera_mp`: Sum of rear and front megapixels.
* `charging_efficiency`: Battery capacity per unit charging speed.
* `ppi`: Pixel density for screen clarity.
* `ram_category`: Binned RAM into categories (Low, Mid, High, Ultra).

These features improve model interpretability and are useful for classification or clustering.

---

### 6. **Correlation Analysis**

* The heatmap revealed moderate to strong correlations between:

  * **Price and performance\_score**
  * **Number of cameras and total\_camera\_mp**
  * **PPI and screen resolution**
* `has_5g` shows mild correlation with features like `performance_score`, `price`, and `processor_brand`, indicating these are useful for prediction tasks.

## ‚úÖ **Conclusions**

* üì∂ **5G adoption** is higher among premium phones, but is increasingly seen in mid-range models without expensive features like NFC or expandable memory.
* üì∑ **Camera configuration** is a strong indicator of 5G support ‚Äî more rear cameras correlate with 5G.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Processor and RAM features** effectively distinguish device segments (budget vs premium).
* üìà **Feature engineering** added meaningful layers to the analysis and is ready for machine learning use cases like:

  * Predicting `has_5g`
  * Clustering phones by price/performance
  * Recommender systems based on user priorities
